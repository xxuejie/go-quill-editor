# go-quill-editor

A [Acme/Sam command language](http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/sam_lang_tutorial/sam_tut.pdf) reimplementation. While the primary target here is [QuillJS's Delta format](https://github.com/fmpwizard/go-quilljs-delta), the interface for working with text is also clearly defined for other possible integrations.
